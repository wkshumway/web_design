	<article role="main">Going to a Ririe-Woodbury performance on campus tod
	  ay was a keen idea.

	  There was a piece called "50 Years" that was loosely based on how Utah
	  wasn't given statehood for 50 years.
	  There was a lot of odd chanting in it and no music. It looked like dis
	  heveled nomads entertaining themselves and attempting to make themselv
	  es comfortable for fifty years.
	  Its oddity was the talk of the people leaving the theater.

	  Somehow it smoothed out bumps in my heart.

	  I feel a lot better.
	  It was worth it, even though I finished my Chinese Remainder Theorem p
	  roject for Discrete Math at one.
