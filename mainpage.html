	<article><p>Going to a Ririe-Woodbury performance on campus
	    today was a keen idea.</p>
	  <p>There was a piece called "50 Years" that was loosely based on how Utah wasn't given statehood for 50 years.</p>
	  <p>There was a lot of odd chanting in it and no music. It looked like disheveled nomads entertaining themselves and attempting to make themselves comfortable for fifty years.</p>
	  <p>Its oddity was the talk of the people leaving the theater.</p>
	  <p>Somehow it smoothed out bumps in my heart.</p>
	  <p>I feel a lot better.</p>
	  <p>It was worth it, even though I finished my Chinese Remainder Theorem project for Discrete Math at one.</p>
